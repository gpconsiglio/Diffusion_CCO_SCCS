# R_Git

This is a dynamic social network (with nodes locked in place) and nodes in the shape of pie graphs.
The data illustrates the diffusion of two pharmacoepidemiological methods (SSC and SCCS) from 1992 to 2013.


# For CG team: file organization -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Diffusion_CCO_SCCS.R is the main script. The script is divided into different sections. The title of the section is the 
name of the script where additional comments and trial-and-error codes are recorded. I tried my best to explain
the code as much as I can!

I originally saved everything in the "d16summer\eGO\R_Files" folder in Dropbox, but as the functions got more
complicated and I ran into more errors, I decided manage version changes on Git. If you need more documents,
you can try digging in there!

The "Data Vis with R.docx" file in the "d16summer\eGO" folder could also be useful.

Let me know if you can't find anything or if you need any help at all :-)
