# R_Git

This is a dynamic social network (with nodes locked in place) and nodes in the shape of pie graphs.
The data illustrates the diffusion of two pharmacoepidemiological methods (CCO and SCCS) from 1992 to 2013.


# Note to self: file organization history (not recorded by Git) ------------------------------------------

Network1.R is the main file. Different files were created to add elaborate comments for CG team members.
Everything is in eGO R_files. Only files relevant to current workflow is in the Git repo folder.

The first major bug happened in the graph.R document.
Originally - graph.R. Version 2 - graph2.R. Version 3 - graph-nick.R
graph.R and graph2.R both had (unlocated) errors. Removed from Git repo (now in eGO\R_files)
graph-nick.R renamed to the graph.R which I'm working off of in the Git repo.
